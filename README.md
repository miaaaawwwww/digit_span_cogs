 <h1>Digit Span Forward Task — COGS108</h1>
  <p>
    This repository contains the code and experimental setup for a
    <strong>Digit Span Forward</strong> task used in the UCSD COGS108 group project,
    <em>"The Effects of Music Genre on Focus and Mood."</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Participants complete a short digit recall task while listening to one of five
    background conditions: <strong>Pop</strong>, <strong>EDM</strong>, <strong>Rap</strong>,
    <strong>Classical</strong>, or <strong>Silence</strong>. The task records
    cognitive performance and self-reported mood and attention data for later analysis.
